# plinkoForC
 The gambling game with falling balls made with C

The program contains a small and very strict version of Plinko. There is no interface yet but I will be implementing as soon as I can.

The program runs a prompt asking how many balls will the user throw, from 1 to 5, also asking the amount of money each ball will cost.
The code will simulate making the ball go either left or right, 16 times. The distance will be calculated for each time the ball fell left (-1) or right (+1). Once finishes falling, depending on the distance, a mutiplier will apply to the value of the ball and sum it up and show the users money before and after the throw.
